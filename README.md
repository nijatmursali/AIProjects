# AIProjects
Projects from Artifical Intelligence course

This project has been done in 2017 if I'm not mistaken. I used Tkinter Python library for the UI. 

The main idea was to create a project that uses A* algorithm and we have created Azerbaijani map that searches for nodes(which were cities in our case) and gives the shortest path from one city to another.
